## Getting Started

First, create a `Next` project
```bash
npx create-next-app [project-name]
```

Choose:
```bash
✔ Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults? › No, customize settings
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … No / `Yes`
✔ Which linter would you like to use? › `ESLint`
✔ Would you like to use React Compiler? … `No` / Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No / `Yes`
✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … `No` / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / `Yes`
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … `No` / Yes
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
